@phdthesis{lobel_optimal_1997,
	address = {Berlin},
	title = {Optimal {Vehicle} {Scheduling} in {Public} {Transit}},
	abstract = {This thesis deals with integer linear programming approaches for the NP-hard Multiple-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem (MDVSP) in public mass transit. "Reasonable" formulations of the MDVSP are based on network flow models and their integer linear programming analogues. In particular, arc-oriented multi commodity flow models and path-oriented set partitioning models (derived by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition) are two customary models for this kind of problem. In this thesis, we investigate both approaches. The main emphasis is on the solution of the multicommodity flow formulation.
The solution methods applied for the two models are branch-and-cut and branch-and-cut-and-price, respectively. Additionally, column generation techniques seem indispensable for both approaches. We have developed new column generation rules that make it possible to solve the huge linear programs with up to 70 million integer variables that come up here. These rules for selecting new columns are based on Lagrangean relaxations and, therefore, called Lagrangean pricing.
For the arc-oriented multicommodity flow approach, we describe the efficient solution of single-depot instances, Lagrangean relaxations, and the LP relaxation. In addition, we propose a heuristic that quickly generates good solutions. This heuristic is based on a schedule first - cluster second approach. For the path-oriented set partitioning approach, we describe its relation to the arc-oriented model.
The second part of this thesis presents the computational investigations of the solution methods that we have developed and implemented. These investigations are based on test data of three large German public transportation companies.
The computational results are excellent: Except for one problem, all encountered test instances can be solved to proven optimality. Compared with the results obtained with the best planning system currently available in practice, our test runs indicate savings of several vehicles and a cost reduction, on the average, of about 10 \%.
The possible profit from using this optimization software is immense. For instance, BVG reckons on savings of about DM 100 million per year, see the newspaper article Auf Sparkurs zum Ziel in Schmidt [1997]. Parts of the presented methods are already integrated in the BERTA system of the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and in the MICROBUS II system of the IVU Gesellschaft für Informatik, Verkehrs- und Umweltplanung mbH, Berlin. Moreover, this system has also been purchased by the research department of the SIEMENS AG, Munich.},
