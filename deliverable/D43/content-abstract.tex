The objective of the ROMSOC project,
is to develop specially-tailored algorithmic approaches
to solve the practical problems posed by our industry partners.
We bring together know-how from discrete optimization to inverse problems,
from deep learning to optimal control.
This way, we gather competences from diverse fields within applied mathematics,
as diverse as the industrial challenges we address:
adaptive optics and electronics, logistics and economic processes
as well as material sciences.
In this report, we summarize the mathematical advancements made in ROMSOC so far
and illustrate how our industrial partners benefit from this work.
