	Abstract = {Assessment of flow parameters provides insight into (patho-)physiology and thus is a common tool in the field of cardiology to screen for or to evaluate and stage cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we present a Flow Analysis Toolbox for Magnetic Particle Imaging datasets highlighting pulsed tracer information. The presented Tool uses time as well as frequency signal processing approaches and exploits an Optical Flow analysis to extract quantitative 4D velocity vectors fields. In this work, we successfully estimate flow patterns in a nonrealistic aneurysm shaped vessel exploiting pulsed tracer information in the Flow Analysis Toolbox.},
